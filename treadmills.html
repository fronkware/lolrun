                            Most treadmills with touchscreens are either android or windows tablets with kiosk modes. Tricks to bypass:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Language changes:</strong> Changing language often loads a default keyboard. Android: hold spacebar/globe to access settings.</li>
                                <li><strong>Slowing down UI:</strong> Switch languages rapidly (e.g., English -> Japanese -> English) to lag the OS and reveal menu bars.</li>
                                <li><strong>Oddball apps:</strong> Look for "debug" or "demo" functions in news/wellness apps.</li>
                                <li><strong>"Wait that works?":</strong> In apps like Peacock TV, type "www.lolrun.com" in search, highlight text, select "visit website".</li>
                                <li><strong>Brute force:</strong> Open apps until one crashes or shows an "About Us" link to a browser.</li>
                                <li><strong>Deep settings:</strong> Look for "accessibility" -> "font sizes" -> "captioning" -> "file browser".</li>
                                <li><strong>USB:</strong> Plug in a USB stick; sometimes a file browser pops up.</li>
                            </ul>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>I changed something and can't undo it, how do I change it back?</strong><br>
                Find the manual for your cardio equipment, perform a factory reset. Some situations may be resolved with a power cycle; most on/off switches are located near the ground at the front of the equipment and will need to be left off for a few seconds before turning back on.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>My treadmill/bike/climbmill/etc. isn't listed above, what should I do?</strong><br>
                If the user interface (screen) for what you want to change looks like others by the same manufacturer, try those at your own risk.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Is it good that most cardio equipment has touch screens with a computer?</strong><br>
                <u>No</u>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Why?</strong><br>
                I'll start with the easy cons: sweaty fingers work better with buttons than touch-screens and most models remove buttons to change speed/settings with touch-screen controls, your gym now needs an IT consulting group to manage these internet-connected devices (and if they don't, I'm sure hackers are happy), more of your data is likely going to corporations (probably the usual stuff like speed and use time, but they also can see your Bluetooth ID on your phone if they wanted and build up individual profiles, maybe pair that with the gym membership list and talk to your healthcare provider how much you actually work out, adjusting group rates, maybe follow exactly what car companies and insurance groups already do).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sure, but it's nice to have something to look at during the workout, right?</strong><br>
                Even if your equipment works with great apps for entertainment right now, it's highly unlikely your gym will keep the equipment up to date, unlikely the manufacturer will update the android/windows tablet, and unlikely that the internet/app you're using will remain compatible in a few years. Even worse, manufacturers can and have “bricked” features that you own, see here. It'd be much better if the cardio equipment controls were separate buttons and an LED display with the basics, and a 2nd touch screen solely for mirroring USB-C input from your phone. Notice how your car's media controls are separate from the actual driving of the car.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>I really don't see the big deal?</strong><br>
                That's ok. But touch screens on cardio equipment still bother me. ONE (1) new climbmill costs $20,000, this treadmill costs $15,000. Look around at any modern gym, assume they replace them every 5 years, do the math and figure out how much of your membership goes towards these $$ machines, and it's very likely the gym bought them with touch screens because that makes them look more modern and capable. BUT, a truly more capable treadmill would be one that can go faster! I'll expand on this example: I'm not saying you can't have a treadmill with a touch screen and have high speed settings, but I have been noticing 16 mph (26kph) treadmills are basically extinct at gyms, 14mph (23kph) ones are endangered, and the 12.4 mph (20kph) are getting replaced by the 12mph (19kph) variants. I know nearly all the speeds mentioned are out of reach of most average runners, but it represents a cultural shift towards entertainment over working out.
                <br><br>
                You're still thinking that 12 (19kph) should be more than enough, and wonder why you and I are having this imaginary back-and-forth on this site in the FAQ section under my anti-touch-screen stance. I'll consider you a friend now, and I'm happy we've chatted this far. Dear friend, I want you to imagine how fast the fastest sprinters go at the Olympics. Yes, that's very fast, treadmills shouldn't go that fast, that'd be dangerous. Now slow down that runner until they're at a run that's barely fast enough to qualify for the marathon: 12.2mph/19.6kph for men and 10.7mph/17.2kph for women, and the men’s record is at 13mph/21kph, women’s is at 12.1/19.5 kph. Those speeds are held for HOURS, so it’s a little ridulous most treadmills can’t go that fast to let you do a 20 second sprint. Imagine the gym gets a new weight set with weights with built-in counters that tell you how many reps you’ve done, but to keep the price competitive, the weights only go up to 40lbs instead of 50lbs (22.6kg→18kg). Reducing motor speeds isn’t inclusive, and can increase how often a treadmill replacement is needed, since slower motors for treadmills means they will be operating closer at maximum capacity for longer. We’re losing as consumers.

            <li><strong>Why lolrun?</strong><br>
                Oh, yes, sorry for getting a little excited with my answers above. It’s easy to remember, and easy to type. Also, it’s how I feel when I walk up to a treadmill that asks me for a login, then after finding the guest/quick start, it asks about a workout I want to do, and I think “lol, run”, where this site offers a few tips on how to just “lol, run”. Or when I see it has a web browser and want to go to google or some news site, but the browser is so underpowered and I just want the browser to “lol, run”, so this site is made very basic to “lol, run”. Or when I’m on a treadmill that has a maximum speed of something slow and it feels like a jog, and I want to “lol, run”, so this site explains how to make your treadmill faster to “lol, run”.
